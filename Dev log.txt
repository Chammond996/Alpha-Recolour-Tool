# Current:
- Loads BMPS, max 100 - may increase to 250
- Create and save up to 10 palettes
- Scroll through sprites
- scroll up/down scale
- Undo - finally
- Very basic UI

TODO / BUGS:
- Large or wide sprites just dont display properly at all (spells are shagged)
- Update the UI, clean it up
- Add support for PNG
- Add support to export BMP->PNG & vise versa
- potential redo button?
- When scaling the sprites will go off screen - scale window also (maybe)
- Handle output properly
- Removal of palettes needed
- Undo needs tweaking
